Getting Started: In today's world of technology, everyone has a smartphone. This is our attempt 
to improve the human life system by using this technology. Since anyone can 
complain here and no one has to go to another office for this, it saves both time 
and money. Moreover, pictures or necessary documents can be attached to each 
report which is not possible in the traditional way. Having more facts makes it 
take less time to solve the problem. Because it is web-based, every moment 
updates are notified to the complainant. At the same time, since other people 
can see all the activities, it is going to ensure the transparency of the 
corporation.
